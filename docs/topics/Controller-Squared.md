# Controller Squared

This repository contains source code for the Imperial College Space Society ([ICSS](https://linktr.ee/ic_spacesoc))'s [Kepler Project](https://icss.notion.site/Project-Kepler-Rocket-Engine-Design-Project-1b700e2236ef4a7496c36f8b64e54684)'s Flow Control Unit. What a mouthful! The **Kepler Engine** is a `LOx/IPA` based liquid rocket engine, pioneering turbo-machinery in student rocketry, designed to attain a thrust to weight ratio of `250`.

As such, we cannot leave the system to be controlled purely by design, luck, or preset commands, and have instead designed this suite of software to control the flow of various liquids through the engine.
