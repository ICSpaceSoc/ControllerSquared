# Kepler project code

## Todo list

- Central algorithm
    - Throw around ideas for the algo [*]
    - Ensure input/output to algo works properly
- Valve control
    - Test if module can receieve commands from Algorithm 
- Comms
    - (not much to be done here yet)
- Sensor input and preprocessing
    - Send spoof input via GPIO ports, ensure can be read
    - 
- Custom PCB
    - Design analog killswitch [*]
- Hardware
    - Research and buy valves and sensors [*]
    - Compile datasheet info (ie: sensor output format) into readable format for future ref.
    - Start designing sensor + valve modules once we settle on sensor + valve specs
- Server-side
    - Set up comms framework (https?) [*]
    - GUI
        - Throw around GUI design ideas [*]
    - Database
        - Test database works
- Others
    - Design data format/systems needed [*]  
(tasks with a * are ones that can be tackled immediately)
